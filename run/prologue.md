Santas always do what is right. Why couldn't you? Why must you run?

You did not want to die. You hadn't wanted her--

Annabelle. Santa. You don't know. You don't know which is right. You know which she'd have wanted, and you want to obey her wishes.

But Santas always do what is right.

"We don't always want to," Mother had said. She was not your mother. Your mother had stood behind you, her eyes cast just below Mother's own. "When others... fail... We don't want to punish them. But it is our duty. We do it because it is right. Santas always do what is right. Understand?"

You hadn't. You had only just been seven years old, you think.

Mother beckoned. Another Santa approached. She wrapped her hands around yours; you could almost feel them through your thick gloves.

"She's been telling you lies, hasn't she, little Santa?" she said. "Shh... don't deny it. Santas don't lie."

Releasing a hand, she wiped a tear from your cheek. Rubbed it between her fingers, until from them a snowflake flew... She glanced after it; took in a small breath--

Mother shook herself. Held her hand out. Onto it, a gloved hand placed a piece of coal, ugly and rough.

Her other hand--still holding yours--gently twisted your palm skyward. Into it, just as the goal had been given to her, she gave it to you.

"You must help your mom do what is right, Santa. Don't you know how?"

No. You didn't know. You didn't want to.

"Think of a warm fire... It wraps its arms around you-- I know this is hard, little Santa, but it will be okay..."

She wrapped her own arms around you, as if she truly were your mother. You felt warmth flood through you. "I know, I know," she whispered. "We don't want to, but we do anyway. We do what is right. Go on, little Santa... lift it to the ball of your hat."

Your arms moved uncertainly around hers. Slowly, you lifted the coal up to the ball of your hat.

"Touch it-- yes, see?"

She released you. The coal had begun to glow. You could feel it grow warn, even through your gloves' thick padding.

"You know what to do, little Santa. Fifteen seconds... and another fifteen for your weakness. No, no... shh... it's not your fault; your mom did not teach you to be braver, Santa. She must learn to do better. You must teach her.

"Hold her arm steady... grip it tight. The coal may feel hot, and your mother may seem unhappy. She may even yell, okay? But your hand must remain firm. The evil must escape, understand?"

You did not.

And your mother screamed.
